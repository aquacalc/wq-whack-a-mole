// Whether working with aquatic production (aquaculture, aquaponics, hydroponics) or recreational (pool, spa, home aquarium) systems, 
The **WQ ToolBox** software can be used without this manual to manage aquatic systems designed for production (aquaculture, aquaponics, hydroponics) & 
recreation (pool, spa, home aquaria).

[p]
This three-part interactive intro to pH is a chapter in the **WQ ToolBox** manual.

[p]
The intent is to strengthen understanding of basic water quality concepts and vocabulary to bridge the gap between simple 
explanations and the tech literature. This will equip users to become more effective and confident WQ managers.

pH is a measure of a solution's acidity.

[p]
In aquatic production systems (aquaculture, aquaponics, hydroponics) and aquatic recreational systems (swimming pools, spas, home aquaria) 
pH generally falls within the range of roughly 6.5 to 8.5.
[/p]

[p]
There are exceptions. Some essential minerals (*e.g.*, iron, manganese, zinc) are only available to hydroponic plants at a pH of about 5.3 
to 6.3. On the other end, pH above 9 is not uncommon in mature high-density cultures of microalgae raised as aquaculture larval feed.

The *pH* symbol was introduced in 1909 by the Danish chemist Søren Peder Lauritz Sørensen as part of his research on beer at the Carlsberg brewery in

#### File under: Interesting factoid

[p]
If you've read other explanations of pH, you might have come across the statement that "p" stands for *pondus* or *potens*, Latin words which may be 
translated as "power", thus making pH "the power of hydrogen". This interpretation is widely repeated.
[/p]

[p]Myers [Cite 
  authors:"Myers, R.J."
  title:"One-hundred Years of pH"
  url:"https://doi.org/10.1021/ed800002c"
  id:"ph-history"
  venue: "J. Chem. Educ. 2010, 87, 1, 30–32"
  date:"2010"
/] looked into it and concluded that there is no evidence to suggest that Sørensen intended it to mean anything other than the letter "p", perhaps 
simply to distinguish one sample from another labeled "q".
[/p]

[p]
A few others (*e.g.*, [a href:"https://derangedphysiology.com/main/cicm-primary-exam/required-reading/acid-base-physiology/Chapter%20106/sorensen-definition-ph-hydrogen-ion-concentration" target:"_blank" rel:"noopener noreferrer"]here[/a]) 
have gone back to the source and point out the "money" sentence on p. 134 of Sørensen's original paper [Cite id:"sorensen" /] where he first introduces the term.
[/p]

[div style:`{marginLeft: '80px', marginBottom: '25px', width: '80%'}` ]
![Sorensen1](static/images/sorensen_134.png)
[/div]

[p]
Starting with "*...und dieser Faktor....*" ([span style:`{fontSize:'0.85rem'}`]end of line 3[/span]), a fair English translation is:
[/p]

[p]
*...and this factor will be written in the form of a negative power* \[Potenz, in German\]  *of 10. By the way, I refer to this in a following section (see p. 159),* 
\[and\] *here will I only mention that I use the name "hydrogen ion exponent" and the symbol p[sub]H[/sub] for the numerical value of the exponent of this power* 
\[again, Potenz\].
[/p]

[p]
Sørensen makes no reference to any separate meaning of "p"; but he clearly defines pH -- which he wrote as p[sub]H[/sub] -- as a *mathematical 
power* (*i.e.*, an exponent).
[/p]

[p]
The word *die Potenz* is used in German mathematics just like it is in English: *i.e.*, raising a number to a power. So perhaps someone inferred that "p" stands for 
*power* and added a Latin flourish. 
[/p]

[p]
But that doesn't appear to have been Sørensen's intent in the passage above: He explicitly used the term *Wasserstoffionen[span style:`{fontWeight:'700'}`]exponent[/span]*, not *Wasserstoffionen[span style:`{fontWeight:'700'}`]potenz[/span]*.)
[/p]

[p]
*Historically interesting?* I think so. 
[/p]

[p]
*Any bearing at all on our water-quality work?* Nope.
[/p]


#### The life of "p"
[p]
Whatever it means -- if anything -- "p" has taken on a separate life of its own in chemical notation: it has been adopted as shorthand for the negative base-10 logarithm, 
symbolized as "-log[sub]10[/sub]".
[/p]

[p]
As you'll see a bit further along, logarithms are one way of transforming very small quantities -- and especially quantities that vary over a wide range of values -- 
into a more human-friendly form. When you dip into the water-quality tech literature, you'll come across not only pH, but also pOH, pK[sub]w[/sub], pK[sub]a[/sub], 
and so forth.

[p]
In practice, it can be challenging to find the pH range that satisfies the criteria of all important water quality properties. For example...
[/p]

[ul]
[li]
When pH is high, CO[sub]2[/sub] and Ω levels may be safe, but UIA may be a problem and hydroponic plants may be unable to absorb essential minerals.
[/li]

[li]
But when pH is low enough for safe UIA, then CO[sub]2[/sub] may be dangerously high, Ω too low to form strong shells, and nitrifying bacteria may not have sufficient
bicarbonate ion (HCO[sub]3[/sub][sup]-[/sub]) to function efficiently.
[/li]
[/ul]

[p]
The following interactive display illustrates this aspect of pH management.

[p]
The game: adjust pH so that all water-quality properties fall within their safe range (*i.e.*, each light is either green or yellow). Your targets:
[/p]

[ul style:`{marginLeft:'40px'}` ]
[li]Carbon dioxide (**CO[sub]2[/sub]**) should be ***less than*** **10 mg/L**[/li]
[li]Un-Ionized Ammonia-Nitrogen (**UIA-N**) should be ***less than*** **12.5 μg/L**[/li]
[li]Aragonite saturation (**Ω[sub]ar[/sub]**) should be **1.0** ***or higher*** [/li]
[/ul]

[p]
Start with a low pH, observe the effects, and then set a high pH to see the change.
[/p]

[p]
Play with pH to find an optimum. How wide (or narrow) is that optimal pH range?
[/p]

[p]
After you've found an optimum pH, change Total Ammonia-Nitrogen (**TA-N**) to see how that upsets the balance (it changes UIA-N); then search for a new optimum pH range.

**The Take-away**: If there *is* a pH optimum -- under some conditions, there isn't -- it's not always easy to find *and maintain* in a real-world setting. 
(And the optimal range may be very narrow, spanning only a few tenths of a pH unit.)
[/p]

Trial-and-error, as in this demo, is an inefficient management approach: you smack down one problem...and another problem pops up somewhere else -- kind of like
